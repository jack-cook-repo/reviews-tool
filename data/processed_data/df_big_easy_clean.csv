"Firstly, we had to queue for ages to be seated as there was only 1 member of staff checking reservations, taking temperatures and seating people. When my friend was downloading the track and trace app the attender tapped her phone which was an invasion on her personal space, and especially during this time. It also took quite a while to be served after being seated. The cocktails were extremely basic and watered down. Presentation was also poor, you could better looking cocktails and Whetherspoons. This is the 2nd time that I've been to Big Easy (last time I went to the one in Leicester Square) and both times my side of Mac & Cheese was forgotten. This time 3 different waiters came to ask if it had arrived and I just ended up cancelling it as I had already finished my starter and main.

"Very poor service made worst by inedible food. We waited 30mins for a table, but when we sat down found that a third of the place was empty...? Unless that many people left all at once? We sat at the front all that time and didn't see that many people leave. Why this was, was made clear later. Very friendly waiter took our very simple order, 3 meat platters 3 cokes. Unfortunately it took 3 reminders over the period of an hour to even get our drinks! I don't think I've ever waited that long for a soft drink. No apology made. Took a further 50mins to get our food. All the while the place was still only a third full. Each of us had ribs, half chicken, some pull pork, chili beans, chips and corn bread muffin. The chicken was well cooked, moist but very bland, there wasn't much in the way of any discernable seasoning. Pulled pork was dry and cold. Ribs are the worst ribs I've ever had, tough as old boots. I've got a decent set of canines but couldn't get through one, they were that tough. The corner bread muffin tasted like a regular muffin, very sweet but quite dense. The best thing on the table were the beans. You could really taste the chili and it wasn't too spicy. The place was obviously badly managed and couldn't handle even a third full service, waiters not paying attention to customers, food badly done and certainly not worth the ¬£32 paid.

I‚Äôm VERY disappointed at my experience at this restaurant. First of all no one came to take our order at our table and we had to go and find them. They served our drinks first but we had to wait 50 minutes before we got our food after asking 2 times about our order and they‚Äôre telling us it‚Äôs been given to a different table. The main course arrived before the starter. They kept forgetting parts of our order and actually gave us the wrong items by swapping what was meant to be on my plate with my partners plate and when it was bought to their attention they told us to move it onto the plate but as I‚Äôm allergic to seafood I wasn‚Äôt able to as I could have a reaction. They placed us close to the smokers area and all we could smell was smoke and when we asked to move they said it‚Äôs the seats were unavailable but the seats was empty throughout our entire during at this horrible restaurant.

"The food was average at best (full of oil, greasy and small portions), but could have been 3/3.5 stars if it wasn‚Äôt for the worst table service I have had in London. We had a table of 4, the first 2 got served after 45 minutes, the waiter then forgot about the remaining 2 and we had to remind a different waiter (the only one not avoiding eye contact with customers) serving another table that we were still waiting for 2 more mains after 1h and 20 minutes (everyone else around who came after got their food before us). Nobody came checking if everything was good, nobody came to ask if we wanted more drinks (the first drinks only arrived after 40 minutes, the second when we were about ready to leave) and nobody was checking on the other tables around us (other people also looked very unhappy about the service). Despite being Covid times and not particularly super busy, they still failed to deliver a decent service. Avoided the 1star just because they took some money off to apologise for the poor service and because the live music was quite decent. They still had the courage to charge a ¬£10 service charge. They need new skilled waiters and more importantly a decent manager running the floor, hard to see them staying in business otherwise. They can do so much better than that.

"My partner had booked the restaurant for my 27th birthday as a surprise, we were very excited. On arrival, the receptionist was not wearing a mask & a couple of other staff were lowering their masks down to their chains, to our surprise. When we were ready to order, 3 out of 5 main items we wanted to order from the menu were out. We were disappointed that they didn't have Calamari, Sweet Potato Fries and any slushy cocktails. In mid order (when I was speaking), the waiter just suddenly moved to another table, which was quite unprofessional. We ordered a cocktail each, one came with Original Lobster Roll, a Crab and seafood platter, a shrimp starter and 3 sides to go with. This is the start of a nightmare. Food took over 45 mins to arrive, by the time the food had arrived, it was 815PM. It was incredibly difficult to get the waiter's attention from our table. We noticed water was dropping from the ceiling to our table when waiting for food, we raised this to the waiter and she just said okay and walked away & didn't offer any alternative solutions or even apologized. A lot of times we had to wave our hands to even get the waiter's attention, our neighbour table was even doing that for us. We had to ask for water 5 times and water was only delivered to our table at 9PM, by which time we had almost finished our meal. We ordered crab so would need special utensils to get the meat out. It didn't come with the food and even after we asked for 3 times it still only came with 1 set for both of us. (We had told her we were sharing all the food). We had tried to get other waiters' attention who passed by, but even they saw us waving at them, they just ignored us, one even was quite rude giving us gestures. When the waiter finally came with water, we had finished our lobster rolls and the majority of the platters, and she tried to remove all food from the table (!!!) however there was still food that we didn't finish, including the crab. We had to tell her that we were still eating the chips and the platter. The food itself was also bad. In my platter there were clams that were not open, which I expected for a restaurant to check their shellfish before serving. All the seafood were extremely overcooked, including the crab & lobster. By that time, we just wanted to go home. We asked for the bill and said could we speak to the manager. The waiter said ""I can try, but there are issues in the kitchen, so the manager probably won't come"". By that time, we asked if there was anything we could do to complain about it, then she again, just walked away. The manager had finally come and we had told him this was a terrible experience, before we even finished our sentences on what went wrong, he said ""I will take care of the bill"" and walked away again, without us telling him why. He came back later with service charge removed & 25% discount on the bill. When we finally could check the bill, there were items that is part of a lobster & cocktail deal where they charged separately, we raised that to the waiter, and she was argumentative said the cost had already been taken off in the -25% goodwill section, we had to explain to her that was not the deal and they were overcharging in the first place. She again walked away and just said okay. Eventually we paid and we left with anger and disappointment. Everything also took so long that we left at 930 PM which was later than we expected. The overall experience was truly awful, they were understaffed and the staff there were very inexperienced. Lots of them walked around like they didn't even know the table number. A lot of items on the menu ran out. My partner was very sorry for ruining my birthday as it was supposed to be a nice treat, but indeed turning into the worst dining experience of our life. We couldn't truly relax there because of the long waiting time and bad service all around. Overall, even if you pay me, I wouldn't return to any one of their chains.

"Was surprisingly disappointed. Been to the covent garden store before and was very happy with the whole experience. This time the experience was completely different and from the start was unhappy. The greeting at the front desk was warm and welcoming, sanitizer and track and trace compulsory and lady at the door stand was polite. Was taken to our table and very disappointed to see there was no social distancing or safety in place that I could see. We was sat at a table that had a small chain link partition to the side of it. This meant our heads were much closer than 1 metre to the people next to us with no masks obviously this was unacceptable. Ask to be moved which we was. I couldn't see any tables reserved to aide with social distancing which has been in place in every other restaurant I have been too. Food was delicious and big portions. Service was slow, mains brought out before the starters were finished, waited 40 minutes for our plates to be cleared, kept seeing drinks taken to the wrong tables including ours. Also observed someone who looked like a manager using the same cloth to clean multiple tables none of which had been sprayed with any kind of disinfectant just asking for cross contamination to happen. As someone who works in the industry, the fact I asked for the service charge to be taken off I think is very telling of the experience. Unfortunately I don't think I would return to this venue any time soon, just doesn't seem safe enough, like profits are being put before people, and staff seem to be too busy to work to their best.",2.0,2021-07-29,10 months ago,2020-10-02,surprisingly disappoint covent garden store happy whole experience time experience completely different start unhappy greet front desk warm welcome sanitizer track trace compulsory lady door stand polite take table disappoint see no social distance safety place could see sit table small chain link partition side it mean head much closer metre people next us no mask obviously unacceptable ask move be couldnt see table reserve aide social distance place every restaurant too food delicious big portion service slow mains bring starters finish wait minutes plat clear keep see drink take wrong table include ours also observe someone look like manager use cloth clean multiple table none spray kind disinfectant ask cross contamination happen someone work industry fact ask service charge take think tell experience unfortunately dont think would return venue time soon doesnt seem safe enough like profit put people staff seem busy work best,[]

The service was quite slow and I feel like there wasn‚Äôt that element of friendliness that you would like to see in a restaurant. The food was quite dry and bland, lacking quite a bit of flavour.

Sent the steak back (the waiter would not accept that I had not ordered a rare, luckily our waitress did) and instead received a steak of the poorest quality meat, that quite frankly looked beaten up. I've bought better braising steak, and god help me, I've eaten better quality from a Wetherspoons. No knuckle breaker brought out for the lobster and nor was the sauce I ordered.

"I normally have nothing but great experiences at Big Easy Canary Wharf. The staff are always friendly and the food is always excellent. Unfortunately this is a complete contrast with my experience this evening. Three elements: 1. Drink order was a tap water. From start to finish of my experience (approx twenty minutes), this simply never arrived despite asking twice. 2. Food arrived cold - the bbq beans were cold and unfortunately were on my plate before I realised. My plate was taken back from me before a senior member of staff asked if I wanted it redone (as in, the entire meal). 3. I was left feeling like I had caused some major inconvenience - like it was my fault that the food had been cold, or that I was being unreasonable asking for my drink order. In the end, I got up and left, asking to cancel my order on the way out. While still in earshot, I heard a member of staff say ‚Äúcancel the order, the guy has just walked off‚Äù. Again, making me feel that I had somehow caused offence. This is such a difference to how I am usually treated in the restaurant. The staff are normally so great so I just don‚Äôt understand it - the restaurant was not particularly busy, there didn‚Äôt seem to be a lot of pressure, but that was the atmosphere I left. In fact, I was so flustered that I ended up running out and forgetting my bag - only for some helpful staff member to kindly put it in the lost property by the door. Which is even more confusing because that‚Äôs the sort of good service I normally receive here! This whole experience has left me feeling extremely uncomfortable and as though I shouldn‚Äôt come to the restaurant during busy times. I would like to thank the staff who located my bag, and I would like to apologise to the staff members who served me, I‚Äôm just not sure what exactly I did that caused such an inconvenience.",1.0,2021-07-29,a year ago,2020-07-29,normally haventhing great experience staff always friendly food always excellent unfortunately complete contrast experience even three elements drink order tap water start finish experience approx twenty minutes simply never arrive despite ask twice food arrive cold bbq bean cold unfortunately plate realise plate take back senior member staff ask want redo as in entire meal leave feel like cause major inconvenience like fault food cold unreasonable ask drink order end get leave ask cancel order way out while still earshot hear member staff say cancel order guy walk off again make feel somehow cause offence difference usually treat restaurant staff normally great dont understand restaurant not particularly busy didnt seem lot pressure atmosphere leave fact fluster end run forget bag helpful staff member kindly put lose property door even confuse thats sort good service normally receive here whole experience leave feel extremely uncomfortable though shouldnt come restaurant busy time would like thank staff locate bag would like apologise staff members serve me im not sure exactly cause inconvenience,[]

"I really would not recommend this restaurant. We are not fussy eaters. But this was poor. Firstly. The good bits. View is great. But the main issue was the service was awful. We had to call a waitress over to take our order. Then we were served main courses, and no one had bothered to take away our empty starter plates. Small issue, but speak volumes about a restaurant. One of our mains didn't turn up. So we had to find out what had happened to it. Apparently there was a ""issue with the system"". So then whilst everyone else was eating I had to sit there and wait for 15 mins for mine to turn up. And it was still missing something. This was made all the more irritating by one of the waiters. Who in the whole time we were sat there, spent most of it wandering round aimlessly, observing himself in the glass and discussing his weekend plans with a waitress. Food was average at best. Slightly better than what you would get at a TGI Fridays or a Harvester. Glad I didn't order the lobster, because with the service at this restaurant, there is a good chance I would have had to jump into the Thames and get it myself. My fries when I got them, were cold. But at that point, we gave up and just wanted to go. We defo won't be going back. My advice is, if you want bbq. Go to bodeans instead.

"Honestly not worth coming here at all, the food is nothing special and is overpriced . We ordered ‚Äò the big pig gig‚Äù and the ribs and it wasn‚Äôt nice at all. All of it was lacking flavour and the cornbread muffin and chicken was incredibly dry. The ribs were also dry and in fact not nice whatsoever . The lobster roll was just okay , too much bread and salad , not enough lobster . The medium lobster was probably the only decent part of our ¬£200 meal, however the garlic butter that came with it was disgusting . The garlic butter from Burger&Lobster is a million times nicer . The lobster Mac and cheese was also okay but considering that it‚Äôs ¬£20 for a small portion with the tiniest bit of lobster is an absolute rip off . Everything is insanely overpriced for poor quality of food. The photos may make it seem like the food could potentially be good but it‚Äôs really not . The waitress also had a bit of an attitude with us , the waiter who gave us our lobster roll told us it was lobster and shrimp and when we tried to complain it wasn‚Äôt what we ordered , the waitress responded with bad attitude, turns out it was correct but that the waiter was confused . However , our waitress also had an attitude with us when she mistakenly thought we ordered the jumbo shrimp when it was in fact the shrimp tacos .

A quick trip to the butchers, the local fruit and veg supplies and the local Supermarket for a good wine... all under ¬£100 would far outweigh the the lack of quality and service received from the Big Easy which would set you back at least ¬£140 for 4 guest.

Have been here a few times now and it‚Äôs consistently just ok. The place does have a good atmosphere and the bar has pretty amazing happy hour prices for drinks (by London standards). Live music in the bar is a bonus but the standard of food varies pretty wildly and even at its best it just doesn‚Äôt come close to other BBQ places in London anymore. The ribs and brisket are decent and the smoked meats are definitely the way to go over the sandwiches etc. The lobster mac and cheese is pretty good. They have a ‚ÄúNashville Hot Chicken‚Äù sandwich on the menu that bears absolutely no relation to any Hot Chicken you would get in Nashville (to the point where it‚Äôs kind of like someone who had never actually tried Nashville hot chicken described it poorly over the phone to someone that wasn‚Äôt really taking notes and they tried to recreate it a few weeks later).

She said yes we could sit if we each ordered an entree. We planned on sharing starters and were told it had to be an entree. Never seen a place with so many staff but such slow service. Half the staff have made it their job to police empty tables and ensure you don't spend your money. We left as couldn't be bothered waiting ages at the bar again.

"I went here on Wednesday night to celebrate a friends birthday. They did all the track and tracing. And then we were escorted to the outside seats. Keep in mind It‚Äôs 8pm and we are near to the Thames so it will be windy. We are seated and immediately we spot that the outside lantern light is not working above us as everyone else‚Äôs. We notify the managers and waiters. They proceeded to pull it multiple times and to no avail, it was still broken. We then asked to move, they couldn‚Äôt move us to a table where there was a working lantern because there was 4 seats and 5 of us. So we then proceeded to ask to be moved inside. We were then asked if we came from the same household and we clearly did not do we were stuck outside. There was no rectifying or even an attempt to make it correct. We said there should be a discount of price to our meals if we are to freeze and eat and they simply declined. A couple also began to smoke near our table as if we weren‚Äôt even there and we had to ask them to move away so we wouldn‚Äôt choke. So please set up a smoking area far away from people that have to eat outside. We ordered our drinks and food, and then after two members from our group ordered the Wednesday meal deal of unlimited wings, they closed the kitchen right after..making their meal very much limited. We spoke to the waiter who was clearly trying his best and the manger did nothing but hover and was willingly checking other tables about their service whilst avoiding eye contact with ours until I called him over. The food was mediocre and I and another member had a stomach run that same night, the service was not the best at all, and I have been here before. We clearly did not pay service charge because what service did we receive.

Transpired that the barman was more interested in serving the attractive women who had just walked in rather than us who were waiting at the bar long before (despite having already seen us!). When I complained to who looked like a supervisor, we finally got served, albeit by a grumpy barman (same one, so obviously didn't take lightly to being told off). However the beer we got was very flat. Rather than making a scene and complaining again (which we should have in hindsight) we decided to leave our drinks and leave this establishment. Worth noting that the 'supervisor' walked past us several times after we got served and not once did she stop and ask if everything was ok. Very poor corporate hospitality!

"Went there with my 14 years old son after visited Moorefield Hospital for a treat at Canary Wharf branch on 17th May. First day that restaurant was re-open for dine in re Covids restriction. Ordered the early bird meal price INCLUDED drink. Didn't check carefully when I got the bill as didn't expect anything will goes wrong. Went back home and had another look at the bill before put it away. Then realised that they charged my drink. So, sent an email to them the next day. And got the reply 3-4 days later asked for my contact number before giving me a refund. Gave them my contact number as per requested. But never get any refund since. It was a shame because I like every thing of this restaurant: the food, the atmostphere, the staff's services etc. They all good. But mistake occured and never been solved spoiled everything. Day after I been to this restaurant; I had ordered KFC for take away. Went back home and eat till nearly finish. Then realised that there was 1 piece short. They are my regular place to visit. I emailed them and they replied the day after with the apologising and explanation that mistake can be occured even though they don't want it to be happened. But happy to know when the problem happened and solve it. And gave me ¬£10 voucher to compensate. It was very impressive really. So much different from The Big Easy. A piece of chicken that short from the order was cheaper than ¬£4 drink they had mistakenly charged me. But handling so much different.

"My last visit at Big Easy was a bit disappointing. Starting with the receptionist, who accommodated us in an unprofessional way, followed by our waiter who took our first drink order after no less than 25 minutes and waiting for our main courses another 40 minutes. In this case, I will recommend that you should be offering a bit more than 1,5h for a table of 2 people as 1h is just for waiting. I normally don't leave bad reviews, but this time I thought you could take it as a way for improvement; your food is good but I believe you don't train your staff properly. Never been asked if we would like more drinks during our meal and always we had to stop our waiter to order, never offered any dessert menu. I could understand when someone is busy, but he had a small section of 4 or 5 tables.

"Attended Big Easy at Canary Wharf on Saturday 16th November 2019 and booked the brunch for 5 people. The BBQ food itself was great and there were no complaints there but when it came to the service that we were provided i was truly shocked. Our first waitress rushed us through the menu and how it worked and immedialtey bought over a bottle of prosecco for the 5 of us, this was fine and we started drinking which then started our 2 hour limit. OUr drinks were finished in about 10 miniutes, we were out for boozy birthday brunch and so we asked our waiter for another drink.20 minutes go by and no drinks and no sign of our waiter so we ask a passing attendee where our drinks are and she says she will go and check. Never returned and still no drinks. Our food then arrives and we ask again for a follow up on our drinks and were advised they were on the way. 40 minutes in and we have all had one drink, not really the definition of 'bottomless brunch' We then ask for simple condoments such a salt, pepper and a sauce. This never turned up and our food was getting cold by this point. Salt and pepper turn as we have all finished, no apology. Our drinks finally turn up and we ask the waitress what the situation is and if we were ordering wrong or something to then be advised that she is no longer serving our table and that we just needed to 'calm down'. This was absolutely unacceptable and not a way to speak to a customer. We were not being rude or shouting just simply asking how it all worked as an hour and a half in and we had only been served 2 drinks. Dinner is done and we ask for the table to be cleared (this should be done without the guest asking) and it was only half done leaving rib bones and pulled pork still all over the table. We ask for our next drink and request 2 each this time owing to the fact of how long it took the first 2 times, we were told we could not do this but that they would fill our glasses up straight away when our first drink was done. We agreed and our drinks were filled. Whilst waiting for our drinks, a desert for one person arrived and we advised that we didn't order this so cant be for our table. Same again, drinks done and asked for refills, 20 minutes later its refilled and the bill was given to us as well, a rude way of saying your time is up, get out. The bill had an additional 2 bottles of prosecco added and desert so this was queried with our 4th waiter of the evening who told us 'I saw the desert come to your table but you turned it away, someone has to pay for it' I have never been spoken to so badly before whilst being out for a meal. The manager was called over after we asked to speak to them and resolve this. She removed the desert and additional bottles of prosecco (they were supposed to be included as the 'brunch'?) We asked for the service charge to be removed due to the abysmal service and was advised 'its been really busy tonight'. This is not an excuse i want to hear, they take bookings and have a venue capacity that they should be able to work to. Do not turn round to the customer and make your problem their problem. I've been to brunches before and they have had waiters walking round filling your glass up when its empty and being very attentive but it was a struggle here to even find someone that could assist you. The manager said she could provide vouchers for our next visit but based on the above, i wont be going back. I am not writing this to bash anyone or the company but to point out some flaws that really didnt need to be flaws. They were issued that could have been easily remedied yet I was spoken to terribly and told to calm down and offered some vouchers. If you were to go here, stick to the main menu and maybe avoid Saturdays? Even though the food was great, this does not make up for the sheer incompetence that myself and 4 friends experienced.

"What a awful experience visiting Big Easy Canary Wharf. This is the first time i have visited this location as I usually attend the one on King's Road. Due to the excellent service and food at the King's Road Branch I thought i would give the Canary Wharf Branch a try and this was a terrible mistake. There were so many things that went wrong from the moment we stepped foot in this place and the fist manager we encountered was not interested! However, the main reason for this review is the service and food that was served to us. my fianc√© ordered a Steak, Medium well done(no blood and no pinkness) and Lobster. What we received the was a cold steak cook medium well. So we informed the waiter, who was happy to change the Steak. We waited 5-10 minutes and the waiter bought back the same Steak that was taken. This wouldn't have been a major issue if the waiter hadn't touched the Steak the first time. We informed the waiter Ivanna that this was the same Steak and she was very surprised the Kitchen had sent back out the same Steak. Again, Ivanna(waiter) took the Steak back to the kitchen. See photos and videos below what was returned after 30-40minutes of waiting for the new meal to arrive. When the first Manager David was called over to the table, he was rude and obnoxious in how he managed the situation. He defiantly needs some form of customer service's training!! I think this is really bad service from this particular branch and think everyone should stay away! I mean its certainly not that difficult to cook STEAK or get it right!!! its not rocket science especially if the Chef is a professional! I HOPE SOMEONE FROM BIGEASY SEE'S THIS COMPLAINT. WE WILL CERTAINLY NEVER BE RETURNING BACK TO ANY OF THE BIG EASY BRANCHES!

This is my favourite restaurant simply because of the food. I have visited here on several occasions and every time I come I have issues. I arrived at 10pm and they told me the kitchen was closed and they were no longer serving anyone. I looked at the door and advised was closing at 00:00 kitchen closes at 11:30pm so I was one hour and 30mins before kitchen closing times. I asked to speak to a manager and was then let in. I do not know if it was a ‚Äòblack‚Äô thing or staff just wanted to go home. Every time I come here the servers act like they do not want to be here. Like you are forcing them for good servicE but when I look at how they treat other customers that are not black I am confused as they are full of life. I am very disappointed in the service I received last time I was here hence the reason why I write this review.

"EXTREMELY RACIST! I went with my partner. We‚Äôre both Pakistani. We didn‚Äôt have a reservation and were told that the next table will be available in 1.5hrs. We quietly went out. I checked on opentable and the next reservation was available in the next 7 mins. I booked that and went inside the restaurant. The receptionist didn‚Äôt see us come back, we were stood in a corner behind the queue. A white couple walked through the door, no reservation, and were given a table straight away. We didn‚Äôt care much because we were about to be seated soon. When we sat down and looked around, there were 8 tables (for 2) available around us. Though some of them got taken up in the next 30 mins of us being there, 3-4 tables still remained empty. So it left my partner and I thinking, what was the 1.5hrs wait for? There was also a balck family (of 4) in front of us in the queue, when we first walked in. They were told there‚Äôs a 1.5 hours wait and were turned away. During our dinner we noticed a table for 4 available which stayed empty the whole time we were there. So once again, what was the 1.5hrs wait for? This is the first time in my ENTIRE LIFE I have felt discriminated against due to my skin colour. I am extremely disgusted. The majority of the customers inside were white and it was well clear what the hell was going on in the restaurant! Would not recommend ANYONE to go there! To make matters worse, we were not given chips with the burgers we ordered and were told that they don‚Äôt give chips with the specific burger we ordered. Which was a big fat lie because few months ago I went there and our meal was with chips. I have the pictures to prove it.

Firstly, unfriendly, unhelpful staff, unwilling to accommodate paying customers, a simple table move was made difficult, even though most of the tables were empty.

The food is subpar, tasteless over fried, presentation is very poor. I am lost that a place like this can even consider serving food of this standard, given how competitive food has become. The manager is friendly, but I feel he needs to be supported, as there was a tense atmosphere, there was definitely a tone of them and us amoung the staff.

"My wife and I tried to call the Resturant to say we may be a few minutes late. We rang 4-5 times. On one occasion the call was picked up and then placed down again. When we got to the Resturant we mentioned this to the staff at the door. They said they were really busy, although there were 3 of them chatting. Then we were told you are not supposed to call that number. We mentioned it was listed on open table and on the web site ? Our table was closed to a door which was open to the outside dining. I appreciate this is due to covid, however it was very cold. Our waitress was very young, we asked her questions about the food. She could n‚Äôt answer any of them. We asked how many wings in the starters. Are they sticky. What are the sausages like? I do not blame the waitress, however the management should allow the staff to have tasters so they know a little about the food. What is the point of having staff, I might as well order from My phone. Our drinks order was wrong and had been billed to another table, so we had to pay this in advance of having starters. The waiters nearly placed our starters on the wrong table. Out main course was placed on another table, Where the occupants had got up for I assume a smoke. The waitress then put the plates on our table. Due to covid concerns we rejected the food. We were told that new meals wood be cooked fresh. When they came out they appeared to be the old ones and Luke warm. My wife had eaten a considerable amount of her meal, when my meal was replaced. This was nit the eating experience we had hoped for. We spoke the manager ‚ÄúLuca‚Äù and he acknowledged the failings and did not charge us the meal.

"I don't know if it was because of lockdown or what but my visit to Big Easy back in May was shocking. We came for the bottomless shrimp/seafood boil. It wasn't bottomless. We were served one portion and when asked to be topped up were informed that the shrimp had run out and not offered an alternative. After speaking with the manager, he did agree to discount our bill. The seafood boil itself was pretty much shrimp and sausage, cubes of boiled potato and cobbettes in passata. No ""cajun"" spices or onions- the passata had just been placed on top. The staff were visibly arguing with each other and after getting the attention of another waiter for the dessert menu- he began to clear our table but when asked for the dessert menu he shrugged, continued to clear the table and walked away. Again having spoken to the manager, he apologised and assured that it's a language barrier and the waiter didn't understand what was being asked??? The dessert was tasty- waffle with vanilla ice cream and hot chocolate sauce and my frozen margarita was refreshing. Nice outdoor seating too- but overall we left incredibly underwhelmed and unimpressed which is a shame because a member of our party even said that the last she attended a couple of years back, she had really enjoyed her meal and experience.

"My first experience at big easy and unfortunately it was not a great one or at all easy. I would use the word, testing! My partner and I have been on leave this week and planned an adventurous week of dining out across london. Big easy was on our list of dine out experiences. A place she has visited many times previously and particularly the canary wharf site which she highly recommended due to her fond encounters. Her recommendation of this place appealed to me as I love bbq and lobster. We decided to visit on the Thursday as the daily offer covered lobster and steak with bubbles for her taste, I liked the sound of all you can eat shrimp on Tuesday as well but settled for surf and turf Thurs as i fancied a cheeky steak. The experience started well, great and easy service when booking a table via telephone and great service when I needed to push our booking back by 15 minutes. Arrived and signed into nhs covid app, restaurant was very empty upon arrival considering the size of the place. Taken to our seats by the front of house staff. Seated by the open door space which my partner was upset about because it was cold and lightly raining. I was EXTREMELY disappointed to realise when ordering that the daily offer didnt include the sirloin steak or any other, other than rump but was satisfied to pay the difference with the surf and turf option offered via the menu. We proceeded to order. Upon arrival of our food I was shocked to learn that surf and turf did not include any sides just meat and fish. I was then advised by my server that i could order a side after having my mains infront of me already. I proceeded to do this and began eating my lobster which was divine by the way with garlic butter. My partners first bite of her steak revealed that the steak was actually ice cold. I followed suit immediately and tasted my own to my surprise, learning also that my steak was cold as ice. Advised the staff of this and our food was taken to the kitchen to be reheated. Upon the return of our meals the steaks were still cold but not ice cold. We decided to preserver with them as is. Our server then proceeded to deliver our sauces but managed to drop half the garlic butter oil and unfortunately for my partner, this went into her handbag. Leaving the bag with a poignant smell of garlic. We then were asked again if everything was alright by the supervisor/ manager and in the time of him asking this question the server whom had dropped the garlic butter came back to wipe my partner's bag and the surrounding area that had been victim of this spillage. We preceeded to finish our food as we were warned from before we sat down that we had an hour and half at the table. I will add that the supervisor did give us a goodwill gesture for the hassle and removed 30 percent of our bill as well as not charging service and for that reason alone i have given an extra star but the experience was underwhelming as a whole and i personally will most likely be visiting a different branch to compare the experience as the food although cold was highly flavoursome.

"Located at the top floor just next to the sky gardens it has a welcome sign outside outside lights as if you're on a movie set ready for action. The staff where amazing when we got there it had started pouring down and we had booked a terrace table which meant it might have affected our booking. Luckily because we came early we had a bit of wait and eventually the rain died down a bit. We eventually got seated and l can safely say we had the best waiter David/Davide Italian guy,tall and just attentive and gave us a personalised service he is an asset to the restaurant. We went for the brunch offer with three of us going for the unlimited Bbq ribs that's comes with chicken,chips,beans and coleslaw. What ld recommend is if you're visiting during brunch hours only 1.person needs to get the ribs as they are huge and enough for everyone to share and it's unlimited you might as well try something else on the menu for variety than have 2 of the same big meal its such a waste. After our meal we took some lovely pictures I the sjygardens right next door to the restaurant. Imagine a massive greenhouse that's just peaceful,green and just puts you intiych with nature all under one globe it us quite the sight.
